Sign Language Prediction Repository
Welcome to the Sign Language Prediction repository! This repository contains two main files demonstrating different approaches to sign language prediction using 
state-of-the-art techniques.

# File 1: Object_Detectron_Based Sign Language Prediction
In the detectron2_sign_language.ipynb file, we explore the application of Detectron 2 â€“ a powerful object detection library â€“ to predict sign language gestures. 
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess data, train a custom model, and use it for accurate sign language recognition. 
The integration of Detectron 2 enables us to leverage object detection capabilities for precise gesture identification.Also the use of different models 
from detectron 2 model zoo provided us with great result for various different model selections.

# File 2: LSTM and MediaPipe Holistic for Real-time Sign Language Prediction
The lstm_mediapipe_realtime.ipynb file demonstrates the implementation of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) combined with MediaPipe Holistic for real-time sign 
language prediction. By utilizing sequential data processing and the holistic pose estimation capabilities of MediaPipe, we create a model that can predict sign 
language gestures in real-time video streams. This notebook guides you through the data preprocessing, model training, and integration with MediaPipe Holistic to 
achieve accurate and dynamic predictions.

Feel free to explore each file, experiment with the code, and adapt the techniques to your specific use cases. We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource 
for advancing sign language prediction using cutting-edge technologies. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach 
out to us.

Happy coding and enhancing accessibility through sign language prediction! ðŸ¤ŸðŸŒŸ
